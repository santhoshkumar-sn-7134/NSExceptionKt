# NSExceptionKt

A Kotlin Multiplatform Library to improve crash reports on Apple platforms.

## Installation

Checkout the implementation specific `README`s for usage and installation details:

* [Crashlytics](NSExceptionKtCrashlytics/README.md)
* [Bugsnag](NSExceptionKtBugsnag/README.md)
* [KSCrash](NSExceptionKtKSCrash/README.md)

## Why this library?

If you have been developing applications for Apple platforms with Kotlin Native, 
then you have likely encountered crashes like the following:

```
Function doesn't have or inherit @Throws annotation and thus exception isn't propagated from Kotlin to Objective-C/Swift as NSError.
It is considered unexpected and unhandled instead. Program will be terminated.

So far so good. You fix the crash and all is well. But what happens when such a crash occurs in production?!  
Well, just like the above message said, the program will be [terminated](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/02901aeb106146274df7cff5686f8e376652fe2a/kotlin-native/runtime/src/main/cpp/Exceptions.cpp#L92).  
And that is probably what you want anyway, so you open your favorite crash reporting tool and...:

```

The good news: you know your app crashed ðŸ¥¸. The bad news: there is no useful stacktrace ðŸ¥¹.

Fortunately we can [log](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.native/set-unhandled-exception-hook.html) 
such unhandled exceptions in Kotlin before the app is terminated! 

## The challenges

While we can use any Objective-C crash reporting SDK we like, 
the concept of error handling is very different between Kotlin and ObjC/Swift.

> On the Kotlin side all exceptions are unchecked, but on the Swift side they are all checked.  
> That's why we need that [`@Throws` annotation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-throws/), 
> which tells Kotlin what exception types a function is expected to throw.

When you try to log your unhandled `Exception`s, you'll soon realise that most SDKs only expose APIs to log `NSError`s.
Unfortunately you can't just map an `Exception` to a `NSError`, for one you would lose the stacktrace.

In the rare case that you can log your exception (e.g. with Crashlytics via the [ExceptionModel] class),
the logged exception will be marked as non-fatal and the real crash is logged as well (resulting in two reports).

[ExceptionModel]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebasecrashlytics/api/reference/Classes/ExceptionModel

So we basically need to:
* log a fatal error from Kotlin
* attach a stacktrace to it
* preferably attach the caused by exceptions (with their stacktrace)
* prevent the Kotlin termination from being logged

I would also like to thank Firebase, Bugsnag and Sentry for publishing the sources of their SDKs.  
Without those sources projects like these wouldn't exist.
